﻿[java - Why is i++ not atomic? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25168062/why-is-i-not-atomic)

> `i++` is probably not atomic in Java because atomicity is a special requirement which is not present in the majority of the uses of `i++`. That requirement has a significant overhead: there is a large cost in making an increment operation atomic; it involves synchronization at both the software and hardware levels that need not be present in an ordinary increment. 

自增长加锁和去锁 , 成本过高 (也就是, 单线程上加锁影响性能)

> You could make the argument that `i++` should have been designed and documented as specifically performing an atomic increment, so that a non-atomic increment is performed using `i = i + 1`. However, this would break the "cultural compatibility" between Java, and C and C++. As well, it would take away a convenient notation which programmers familiar with C-like languages take for granted, giving it a special meaning that applies only in limited circumstances.
>
> Basic C or C++ code like `for (i = 0; i < LIMIT; i++)` would translate into Java as `for (i = 0; i < LIMIT; i = i + 1)`; because it would be inappropriate to use the atomic `i++`. What's worse, programmers coming from C or other C-like languages to Java would use `i++` anyway, resulting in unnecessary use of atomic instructions.

语法角度上, 如果++是原子, i=i+1是非原子, 不利于C, C++程序员的使用.  (其实, 我们的根本需求是不想知道是否原子, 然而分开处理并没有任何作用)



> Even at the machine instruction set level, an increment type operation is usually not atomic for performance reasons. In x86, a special instruction "lock prefix" must be used to make the `inc`instruction atomic: for the same reasons as above. If `inc` were always atomic, it would never be used when a non-atomic inc is required; programmers and compilers would generate code that loads, adds 1 and stores, because it would be way faster. 

大致就是说, 机器无法判断是什么时候使用原子的自增长和非原子的自增长





而我们的根本需求,  是不需要考虑自增长是否原子



**结论 , 无法实现该“不需要考虑自增长是否原子操作”的原因是：**

1. **性能消耗大, 无法忽视。**
2. **编程语言以及现今的技术，无法分辨出原子和非原子的需求。**
