## 创建EC2

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.![Screenshot from 2021-04-29 21-26-41](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-29 21-26-41.png)
2. From the console dashboard, choose **Launch Instance**![Screenshot from 2021-04-29 21-47-14](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-29 21-47-14.png)



3. The **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** page displays a list of basic configurations, called *Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)*, that serve as templates for your instance. Select an HVM version of Amazon Linux 2. Notice that these AMIs are marked "Free tier eligible."  选择镜像![Screenshot from 2021-04-29 21-52-08](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-29 21-52-08.png)

4. On the **Choose an Instance Type** page, you can select the hardware configuration of your instance. Select the `t2.micro` instance type, which is selected by default. The `t2.micro` instance type is eligible for the free tier. In Regions where `t2.micro` is unavailable, you can use a `t3.micro` instance under the free tier. For more information, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).  选择实例类型

关于 Instance Type 可以看该[网站](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/ec2/instance-types/)。选择 Instance 需参考 Family（系列）、type（系列底下的机型）、vCPU（虚拟CPU）、内存、存储类型、[EBS-optimized](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html) Available（EBS是否优化）、网络性能、是否支持IPv6

5. On the **Choose an Instance Type** page, choose **Review and Launch** to let the wizard（启动向导） complete the other configuration settings for you.
6. On the **Review Instance Launch** page, under **Security Groups**, you'll see that the wizard created and selected a security group for you. You can use this security group, or alternatively you can select the security group that you created when getting set up using the following steps:
   1. Choose **Edit security groups**.
   2. On the **Configure Security Group** page, ensure that **Select an existing security group** is selected.
   3. Select your security group from the list of existing security groups, and then choose **Review and Launch**.![Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-06-13](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-06-13.png)

7. On the **Review Instance Launch** page, choose **Launch**

8. When prompted for a key pair, select **Choose an existing key pair**, then select the key pair that you created when getting set up.  选择密钥
   When you are ready, select the acknowledgement check box, and then choose Launch Instances.![Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-11-09](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-11-09.png)

9. A confirmation page lets you know that your instance is launching. Choose **View Instances** to close the confirmation page and return to the console.  点击展示实例![Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-13-28](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-13-28.png)

10. On the **Instances** screen, you can view the status of the launch. It takes a short time for an instance to launch. When you launch an instance, its initial state is `pending`. After the instance starts, its state changes to `running` and it receives a public DNS name. (If the **Public IPv4 DNS** column is hidden, choose the settings icon ( ![img](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/settings-icon.png) ) in the top-right corner, toggle on **Public IPv4 DNS**, and choose **Confirm**.![Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-15-27](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-15-27.png)![Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-15-41](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-15-41.png)
11. It can take a few minutes for the instance to be ready so that you can connect to it. Check that your instance has passed its status checks; you can view this information in the **Status check** column![Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-38-08](/assets/blog_res/Screenshot from 2021-04-30 00-38-08.png)
